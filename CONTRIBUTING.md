# Contributing to the Devz process

## What

The playbook is still fairly new, so there are many opportunities to add useful
content. Here are some examples:

* Build out the Ruby section
* Add a Rails section
* Expand on the Python section
* Curated list of books, articles, newsletters, courses, tutorials
* Recommended tools
* Create separate pages for the various editors and IDEs, and expand each with
more helpful plugins, keyboard shortcuts, and other productivity tips.
* How to be an effective engineer

## When

I aim for the playbook to be a living document. Outdated information can be
worse than no information. If I change my opinions or processes, I should
strive to update the playbook shortly thereafter.

If you feel important content is missing, please submit a PR if you have the
time.

## How

Contributing is as easy as submitting a PR. Please request a review from one or
more of these Fronters I have identified as curators for particular areas of
knowledge:

* Bash - TBD
* Django - TBD
* Docker - TBD
* General Backend - TBD
* General Frontend - TBD
* Go - TBD
* Infra - TBD
* Python - TBD
* Rails - TBD
* React - TBD
* Ruby - TBD
* Security - TBD

If you are adding new content, please follow my
[templates](./templates/README.md). If you are updating existing content, and
you notice that it does not adhere to my templates format, please update the
format in a separate PR if you have time.
