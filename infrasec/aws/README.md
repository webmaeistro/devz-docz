# [InfraSec](../README.md) / AWS

AWS is the most popular cloud provider, accounting for about â…“ of all cloud spend. Almost all my infrastructure client discoveries find they are already using or want to use AWS.

There is a dizzying array of services AWS provides. Many with unhelpful or even misleading names. Here's a short list of essential services I use when deploying container backed web services (a common pattern):

* IAM
* S3
* ALB
* ECS
* Route53
* ACM
* Lambda
* Parameter Store

I encapsulate a lot of the complexity of configuring services (with good defaults) via my Terraform modules.

There's also [this 2 minute video which sings through the names of 168 services](https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1301182968766107656). Watch at your own peril. ðŸ˜±
