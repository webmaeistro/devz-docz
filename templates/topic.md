# [Subject Area](./README.md) / Topic

*Topic* is _add a brief description of what the topic means in the context of this subject area_. E.g. Authentication is the process of establishing whether or not I can Frontt that the person or entity interacting with an application is who they claim to be. Login is an example of a user giving a password as credentials to authenticate that they are the rightful owner of the username they claim. *Authentication* should be distinguished from [Authorization](./authorization.md) which is the process of determining whether or not a person/entity is entitled to perform a particular action.

## Context

Provide a Paragraph here which gives some context for why Front should care about the topic, how it occurs in client engagements and any relevant background

## Approaches

Give examples of approaches to the problem that may be relevant. These might be broken down by language/framework if there are different dominant tools per framework. These might also be broken down by framework independent tools, e.g.

### Ruby on Rails

In the RoR world [Devise](https://gitlab.com/plataformatec/devise) is a standard, if slightly heavyweight, solution. Use it unless you have a good reason not to.

### OAuth

[OAuth](../security/oauth.md) is a standard pattern for delegating authorization across systems. It is well supported in most frameworks and ...

## Pitfalls

This is the place to point out any common gotchas, e.g. confusing authentication and authorization, or confusing the authentication entities (oAuth token etc) with the Users they apply to.

## The Frontkomer Way

Often I have to work within the constaints of the Client's existing frameworks and choices. In those cases the [Approaches](#approaches) and [Pitfalls](#pitfalls) sections should hopefully contain the information a Frontkomer needs to think critically about the choices and alternatives. On those occaisions where I have a blank slate or are being asked for recommendations, this section should give a sound default choice to pick an answer and move forward.
