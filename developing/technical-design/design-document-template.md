## Overview

In one or two sentences,
summarize what the problem is and how you intend on solving it.
It's helpful to outline the stakeholders here,
as it informs why this problem merits solving.

## Background

This section is for going into more detail about the problem.

* Who are the stakeholders and how have they been impacted?
* Historically, what effect has the problem it had?
* Is there data to illustrate the impact?
* Is there an existing solution?
  If so, why does it need to be improved on?
* Are there past projects or designs to link for context?

At least one example should be used to help the audience understand the context better.

## Proposed Solution

Detail your solution here.
Start with a broad overview and then go into detail on each portion of the design.

* What changes will the stakeholder/client see?
  This should clearly illustrate how the stakeholders' needs are being met
* How exactly does it solve the problem outlined above?
  Explain how this solution applies to the use cases identified.
* Why are you picking this solution?
* What are the limits of the proposed solution?
  At what point will the design cease to be a viable solution?
* How will you measure the success of your solution?
* If priorities shift or the solution becomes too cumbersome to implement, how will you roll back?

Visual representations of the solution can be helpful here (ex. a diagram for a request lifecycle).

## Implementation

Without going too much into individual tasks,
write an overview of what this solution's implementation would look like.

* Can this be broken down into multiple technical efforts?
* What is the tech stack involved?
* Will additional infrastructure be needed to achieve this?
* How will you test this?

## Trade-offs

* This section should go over other possible solutions,
  and why you chose yours over them.
* Was there a build vs. buy solution?
* What industry standards/practices already exist?
* Why is your solution better?

## Cross Team Dependencies

If there are multiple teams or clients that are dependencies for implementation to be successful,
list them here.
Examples of this are security or design collaboration/reviews.

## Further Reading

List any resources you found helpful to make this design.
