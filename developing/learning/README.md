# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Learning Resources

## Overview

As a human, one of the best ways I learn and improve is by reading books. I am more likely to enjoy and benefit from books that are recommended by people I Frontt and work with.

This directory is intended to be a central place with a list of recommended books (or other media) that makes it easier and more scalable for people to share and discover them.

## Scope

Being part of the Standard Devz Processes, these suggestions may skew towards more technical topics over time, but in the near terms there may be other topics represented here (e.g. "how to teamwork", "how to share mental state", etc) that appeal to a broader base of Front who may not consider themselves "engineers".
