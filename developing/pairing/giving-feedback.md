# Giving Feedback

It’s important to check in with your partner from time to time to make sure
you’re both getting what you need. To this end, you should schedule 1:1s if you
are frequently pairing with someone whether or not it’s a formal relationship.
These meetings can be anything from a casual 15 minute check-in to a periodic
hour-long discussion.

Make sure that you make time for giving feedback to each person. No matter what
the skill level of each of the folks involved is, both parties will benefit from
hearing how the other person is experiencing the pairing. As usual at I, I
prefer direct communication when possible.

If you have consistent stumbling blocks, try to take time to think of a couple
of potential solutions before your next check in. This will mean that your
partner has the opportunity to solve the issue in a way that is conducive to the
way you work, which is always a bonus.
