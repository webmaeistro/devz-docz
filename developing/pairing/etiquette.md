# Remote Pairing Etiquette

- Ask before grabbing the mouse / keyboard
  - Sometimes you need to move the cursor to get it back onto your local screen.
  Try to end each driving session with the cursor already on your screen.

- Turn off notifications or consider using a tool to block other applications
while pairing

- Make sure to think out loud as much as possible since it can be very difficult
to follow what someone is doing through screensharing

- If you need to mute the other person or step away for any reason, make sure to
notify the person you are pairing with

- If you need to take a break, say so and agree to come back after a fixed time
span.
