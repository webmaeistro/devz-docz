# What Works Well

- Sitting next to each other and talking through a task.

- Doing a task in parallel, i.e. each doing roughly the same things on their own
computer.
  - This is especially good when learning a new piece of software, since neither
  of you know it out of the gate, and watching someone explore can feel clumsy
  and wasteful.

- Sharing a computer

- Switching off driving (having the less senior person drive when time less of
an issue)

- Daily check-ins: discuss the tasks you’ve done since you last spoke/expect to
do in the near future.

- The task leader goes through a task (at least partially) on their own first,
and then brings the other person through

- If additional research is needed to continue, make a plan to separate for a
set amount of time and then return to go over discoveries

- Pair from the beginning of the task/feature/bug fix. Don’t try to start
mid-effort.

## Specific to Remote

- Screen sharing (MacOS has built-in screen sharing with the Messages app)

- Different time zones:
  - Ensure that the person who is going to start work first the next day knows
  what they’re going to do before you quit for the day. Especially important for
  Junior/Senior pairs.
