# Why Pair

- Get to see the tools another person uses.
- Get to see how another person problem-solves.
- Bounce ideas off one another; helps prevent anyone from getting stuck for too
long.
- Not working in a vacuum/reality check.
- Learn by doing, combined with learn by seeing, combined with learn by hearing
(AKA all the learning styles at once!)
- Understanding a problem better because you have to explain it (AKA rubber
ducking.)
- When you’re reporting what you’ve done to someone else, you’ve already had
practice explaining it.
- Write code with built-in code review! (You still need to open a PR and get a
review, unless your project lead deems otherwise.)
- Brings engineers up to speed/spreads knowledge.
- Builds camaraderie & collaborative team unity.
