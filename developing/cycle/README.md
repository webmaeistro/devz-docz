# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Development Cycle

## Overview

At Martin's experience, I practice agile with a small "a". This means getting back to the basics of what it means to [develop software with agility](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html):

> * Find out where you are
> * Take a small step towards your goal
> * Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
> * Repeat

In order to implement these principles, I do a few things:

* Planning and executing tasks in repeated cycles, called Sprints
* At the end of each cycle, I review my work and whether or I accomplished what I set out to do.
