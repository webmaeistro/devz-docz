# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Programming Languages

## Overview

This section will contain my collective observations about the strengths and challenges offered up by many of the different programming languages out there.

While I may have opinions on particular languages and strategic reasons for investing in some languages over others, I recognize that my clients will may make different choices for different reasons. As such, I should aim to be proficient in more than one language and able to get by with several.

## Languages Martin is proficient in

* [Go](./GO.md)
* JavaScript (including TypeScript/FlowScript)
* PHP
* [Ruby](./ruby/README.md)
* [Python](./python/README.md)

* [bash](./BASH.md)

## Language Resources

### Go

If you are new to Go, these are resources that can help you get started:

1. [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org) (in-browser interactive language tutorial)
1. [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) (info about the Go environment, testing, etc.)
1. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) (how to do things “the Go way”)
1. [Daily Dep documentation](https://golang.gitlab.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html) (common tasks you’ll encounter with my dependency manager)
1. [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/go/about) offers a series of exercises with gradually increasing complexity

Additional resources:

* [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/) (where you can read the docs for nearly any Go package)
* Check out the [Go wiki](https://gitlab.com/golang/go/wiki/Learn)
