# [Python](./README.md) / Installation

## Python

Use Python 3.

Use `brew` in order to keep Python up to date. Install the latest version like so:

```
brew install python
```

## Pipenv

If you also need a local Python development environment, I recommend using `pipenv` to provide a virtual environment. Install it using homebrew:

```
brew install pipenv
```

To create a local development environment and a `Pipfile`, specify the specific python interpreter to use:

```
$ pipenv --python 3.7.6

To work within the development environment, use `pipenv shell`.

To install additional dependencies for the project, use `pipenv` and **not** `pip`:

```
pipenv install flask
pipenv install pytest --dev # install a dependency only needed for development
```
