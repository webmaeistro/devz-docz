# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Source Control

## Overview

Source control has less to do with the VCS system you use, and more to
do with the stages code goes through on the journey from inside a
developer's head, tested and merged into the main line, deployed to
production, and thence in time to being identified as that accursed
legacy system that is causing all the problems.

At I, most of my projects will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as
their VCS, and usually with [gitlab](https://gitlab.com) as the host for
their repositories, but this is not a hard and fast rule (clients will
often host their own repositories in their own system).
