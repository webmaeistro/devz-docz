# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Growth

## Overview

When working on a project, it's important to allow time for career
growth. Folks will have different levels of experience and will need
to explore areas that are not directly related to completing project
work.

The experience at I is that this exploration winds up benefiting
the client in the long run, both through immediate impact (e.g.
speeding up tests) and the client getting the benefit of learning that
happened elsewhere. Allowing time for growth ensures consistent, high
quality work which benefits everyone.

Mentoring is an important part of growth.

To ensure that growth happens, the time should be built into the
estimate for a ticket. From time to time, it will be appropriate to
restrict exploration and "just get the ticket done", but that should
happen infrequently.

If someone is interested in a topic that is not related to their
client work, a separate plan will need to be made.  That might involve
changing client teams, changing client projects, or joining I
Reserve.
