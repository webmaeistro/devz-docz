# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Editors, IDEs and Debuggers

## Overview

I don't care which editor/IDE/debugger that you use - it's your workflow. That said, I do think there is enormous value to be had from a well configured working environment that leverages available tooling. For example, knowing how to use some form of debugger will significantly improve your productivity and reduce the daily frustrations of developing code.

In this section you will find overviews of the range of tools to use and suggestions on how best to configure each tool for the situations I most often use them.
