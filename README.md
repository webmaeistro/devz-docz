# Standard Devz Processes

## Purpose

This is my thoughts and insights and opinions regarding engineering tools, processes, and practices. The problems and choices that I encounter in my day-to-day practice are rarely new. Having a straightforward way of applying the things I collectively know to the problems I face would be a source of great efficiency for me.

This collection of documents is intended to be simple and searchable, each one containing the essence of my observations and incorporated in docs improvments and opinions on a particular topic. Whilst any Frontkomer is free to edit these documents, there is some expectation that these are to be curated by the broad engineering community at Martin's experience. To that end, proposed changes should be submitted via a PR and  SMEs will be identified to act as curators for particular areas of knowledge.

### Public repo

One question I might ask is whether or not this repo should be public? My inclination is to say yes and use it as a way of demonstrating to customers and potential hires what to expect from working with or for Martin's experience.
